# Code Climate Flake8 Engine

`codeclimate-flake8` is a Code Climate engine that wraps the [Flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8) source code analyzer. You can run it on your command line using the Code Climate CLI, or on our hosted analysis platform.

### Installation

1. If you haven't already, [install the Code Climate CLI](https://github.com/codeclimate/codeclimate).
2. Enable the engine through the beta channel in your .codeclimate.yml file:
```
engines:
  flake8:
    enabled: true
    channel: "beta"
```
3. You're ready to analyze! Browse into your project's folder and run `codeclimate analyze`.

### Configuration

You can configure which files to be analyzed in your `.codeclimate.yml` file.

Other configurations can be made through a `.flake8` file. More information can be found on [Flake8's documentation](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)

Plugin activation can also be made in `.codeclimate.yml`:

```
engines:
  flake8:
    enabled: true
    channel: "beta"
```
