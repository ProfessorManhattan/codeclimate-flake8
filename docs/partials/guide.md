## Configuring Flake8

This project is configured to look for the configuration for Flake8 at `.config/flake8.toml` first before reverting to the standard location.

## Extending Flake8

This engine currently just loads Flake8 without any additional plugins. If you feel like this engine could be more valuable with additional plugins, and you know how to properly implement the plugins, please open a PR.
